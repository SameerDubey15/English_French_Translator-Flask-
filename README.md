# English-French Translator

This code repository contains an English-French translator, implemented using Python. The translator utilizes a pre-trained neural machine translation model to convert English text into French.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that the following requirements are met:

- Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.
- The required Python packages are installed. You can install them using the following command:

## Usage

To use the translator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the following command to start the translator:
4. Once the translator is running, enter English sentences or phrases that you want to translate into French.
5. Press Enter to receive the translated text.
6. To exit the translator, simply type "quit" or "exit" and press Enter.

## Configuration

The translator uses a pre-trained model for English-French translation. The model is already included in the repository and does not require any additional configuration.

## Acknowledgments

The translation model used in this project is based on deep learning techniques and trained on a large English-French parallel corpus. The training process and model details are beyond the scope of this README file. However, if you're interested in the technical details, please refer to the relevant research papers or online resources.
